# Title: Arc Search Android Address Bar Spoof Using Fullscreen

## Description: 
When requesting full screen inside Arc Search for Android the browser doesn't show any prompt or indication that the view is changed to full screen and the toolbars are hidden now, With this issue we can request a full screen on attackers site and re-create all the toolbars to show a spoofed origin tricking the user into thinking they're on legitimate site.

When requesting full screen usually an indicator or a message is shown like this

Using some JS and CSS tricks I was able to almost spoof the address bar components when viewed in full screen.

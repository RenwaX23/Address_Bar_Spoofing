When a browser changes a view from a normal view to a full screen it will show a toast or alert message indicating the screen is now in full screen this message informs the user so it doesn't get tricked when the attacker moves to fullscreen and spoofes the UI, here is example messages from Chrome and Firefox
Arc doesn't show any messages and indicators it will straightly go to full screen and this will allow a potential UI and address bar spoof

# Title: Brave iOS Address Bar Spoof Using 2 RTL (Arabic Characters) Subdomains

## Description: 
The issue arises when using 2 RTL characters in different level subdomains and in between add a domain that we want to spoof. First we add a RTL character then any domain we want to spoof and in the end we add another RTL character that will confuse the address bar and mixes up the RTL LTR showing of the URL.
Expected Result
Address bar showing ....google.com.ە.pwr.wtf
Actual Result
Address Bar shows wwww.accounts.google.com.ە

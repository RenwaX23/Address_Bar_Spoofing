# Title: Arc Browser address bar spoof using file:// URI

## Description: 
While viewing an offline downloaded HTML file on Arc I noticed instead of viewing the page origin it will show the full URL which allows us to spoof the address and trick the user to visit unwanted sites. Since the address is small the beginning of file:/// URI will be hidden and only the last part will be shown.

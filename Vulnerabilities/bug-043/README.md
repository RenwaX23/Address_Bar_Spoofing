# Title: Firefox Mobile iOS Address Bar Spoof Using Server-Side Redirect to non-http Scheme

## Description: 
When we open a new window pointing to something like x://google.com or tel://google.com the browser address bar will show us as google.com and the origin of the tab will be the opener, which with this we can have any URL displayed as the address bar and change contents of the tab using the window reference thus getting address bar spoof vulnerability.

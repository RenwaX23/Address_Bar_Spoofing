# Title: Address Bar Spoofing Using blob: URI

## Description: 
The Arc Browser doesn't display blob: URIs correctly, for http and https schemes only the origin is displayed but when using the other schemes the last part of the url is displayed for example blob:https://example.com/asd-asd-asd inside the UI it's displayed as asd-asd-asd when navigating top window to it. this will allow full address bar spoof and tricking users into sending sensitive data.

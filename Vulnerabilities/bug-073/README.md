# Title: Edge Mobile (Android-iOS) Full Address Bar Spoof Using Bing and Path Traversal

## Description: 
Hey Edge Team

Intro

While looking at Edge mobile I found an address bar spoof issue using the Bing search functionality, this allows an attacker to control the address bar and change the page contents.

Bing Search

In Edge mobile when we search for something like test the browser will redirect to https://www.bing.com/search?q=test and URL bar is changed to test , this itself is not a vulnerability but rather a useful functionality but chaining with other Bing functions we can get address bar spoof.

Path Traversal

The browser checks the origin and path to start with https://www.bing.com/search and then will grab value of ?q= parameter and updates the address bar but There is a path traversal issue inside Bing.com which allows us to trick the browser thinking it's on a legitimate search origin but in truth it's in another location, using https://www.bing.com/search%2f..%2ftest the server side will display contents of /test but the browser thinks it's /search and processes to change the URL bar  

Bing Images/Videos

We can demonstrate two examples using Bing Images search results and Videos.

We can host a malicious image on our domain then when Bing crawler crawls the image it will be hosted on bing.com/search%2f..%2fth/â€¦ then by adding ?q=www.google.com we can spoof the address bar thinking its on google.com and displaying our image.

We can also use the Copilot to create our desired image and use it for spoofing.

Bing also has a functionality which embeds videos inside itself without need to leave the search results this also brings a new attack vector we upload a malicious video which will be embedded inside bing.com and use the ?q= parameter to spoof the URL

Full Content Control

While researching into this I wanted something more powerful rather than image/video so while looking I found bing.com/qsml.aspx?query=anything which is a search suggestion page that returns our full input inside body of the page without any limitation now with just adding ?q= parameter to it we can have full address bar spoof with arbitrary body contents.

Please check Steps to Reproduce section for all POCs and better understanding.

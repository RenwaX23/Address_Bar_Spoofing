# Title: Opera Mini - Full Address Bar Spoof

## Description: 
Summary
Opera Mini for Android doesn't correctly shows address bar when pasting into the URL bar this allows spoofing the origin of the site and bypass second most important browser feature.

Pasting into address Bar
Most of the times people are lazy and don't write the whole URL manually so they rely on copy pasting URLs to address bars and navigating to it, the browser should display the URL correctly after navigation so the user doesn't get spoofed and makes a double check.

In Opera Mini when the URL is long and pasting it into the address bar it will only show last parts of it not showing the real origin of the site, this will allow a full address bar spoof.
